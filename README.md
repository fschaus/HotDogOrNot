# Purpose:

Mini app to test Apple new CoreML framework, for image recognition. It replicates the infamous SeeFood app from HBO's Silicon Valley show, by letting user take pictures of objects, which are then identified (with varying degrees of precision) using Google's Inception V3 Machine Learning model.

# Key learnings:

- Learned how to leverage Apple's new CoreML framework for image recognition features
- Identified trade-offs between various Machine Learning models (in terms of precision, size, etc.)
